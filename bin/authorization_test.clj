;; The difference between a 401 and 403 is whether the authentication
;; scheme has returned any creds at all. If no credentials have been
;; established by the authentication (perhaps because the credentials
;; aren't valid, like a wrong password), then 401 Unauthorized
;; indicates that the user should try again with some creds. If there
;; are some credentials, then 403 indicates that the credentials
;; aren't sufficient. The difference is important, because a 401 is
;; accompanied by a challenge to the user-agent to retry with
;; different credentials via the WWW-Authenticate header. The 403 does
;; not cause the WWW-Authenticate to be returned in the response.
