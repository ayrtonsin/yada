= Change Log

== [1.2.9]

- Breaking change: Removed feature where response functions could be
  any arity. They must now be a single arity (taking the request
  context). This was removed because when there is an ArityException
  in user code it was being masked by this catch handler logic. Please
  ensure your response functions are single arity.

== [1.2.0]

- Refactored to extract out non-core areas of functionality in `ext/`.

- Alternative APIs now possible - APIs used potemkin to collate vars
  for public use. The namespace is always `yada.yada` and can be each
  API can be found under `bundles/`.
