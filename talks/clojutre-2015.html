<p>
Hi! I'm Malcolm Sparks and I'm going to start by talking about HTTP.
</p>

<p>
We all know HTTP. It's the protocol that underpins the web.
It's a big and complex specification.
</p>

<p>
There's an awful lot of stuff in HTTP, some of which you will know, some of which you may not.
</p>

<p>
But why is it so big and so complex?

<ul>
<li>scale</li>
<li>longevity</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
It's because HTTP is for services that are designed not to break. It's for services that must adapt and survive, maybe for decades, in an environment that is constantly evolving, not just the application, but the world around it too.
</p>

<p>
HTTP 1.1 has been stable for well over a decade, over that time we've seen it become ubiquitous, from servers, from gateways and proxies, in hardware, to browsers, to mobile devices and even embedded into micro-controllers. We might as well make use of these features now.

<p>
But what about Ring middleware?
</p>

<p>
With Ring middleware, we use higher-order functions which derive new <i>augmented</i> handlers that wrap the original. This is a form of functional composition.
</p>

<p>
It's highly modular, because Ring wrappers are decoupled from each other. From the standard point of simplicity, it's great design.

<h2 id="orgheadline7">Is Ring middleware suitable for building HTTP services?</h2>

<p>
But the question I want to pose is this: Is Ring middleware the right tool for building HTTP services?
</p>

<p>
Generally, I'm a fan of functional programming. I love when I can solve a problem elegantly by composing functions together.
</p>

<p>
Composing functions is cool. But we don't often hear the case against, so let me present it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples.

<p>
― RFC 7231
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
My first example has to do with Ring's implementation of HTTP's HEAD method.
Let's first remind ourselves what the HEAD method is for.
</p>

<p>
HEAD allows clients to see the headers they would get from a GET request without having to pull the whole message payload.
</p>

    request))

  {:added "1.2"}
  [response request]

    (assoc response :body nil)
    response))
</code></pre>
</div>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Here is Ring's middleware implementation of HEAD
</p>

<p>
In the first function, which processes the request, we take a HEAD request and turn it into a GET request. OK.
</p>

<p>
In the second function, we process the response. We replace the body with nil.
</p>

<p>
Q. Can anyone see anything sub-optimal here?
</p>

<p>
Yes, it's compliant. But it's also inefficient and a waste of resources that could be precious to you.

<h2 id="orgheadline11">Example B: Compojure routing</h2>

  (POST "/hello" [] (fn [req] (launch-missiles!))))

<ul>
<li>Q. Which HTTP status do we get from this Ring handler if we send a <code>PUT</code> request to <code>/hello</code>?</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Q. Which HTTP status <i>should</i> we get?</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Let's move on to my second example. Here we have 2 functions, composed together. They happen to be Compojure macros rather than Ring middleware, but they illustrate exactly the same problem.
</p>

<p>
So question 1: Which HTTP status do we get from this Ring handler if we send a <code>PUT</code> to <code>/hello</code>? (wait for answer) Right, a 404. And a bonus question for the HTTP nerds here &#x2026; (click next slide) &#x2026;  which HTTP status <b><b>should</b></b> we get? Anyone? Yes, that's right: a 405.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the modularity of this design, causes us a problem. The fact that the GET and POST operations are ignorant of each other's existence, and that the composed function has no knowledge of the nature of the functions it is composing, means that we cannot know to send a 405 rather than a 404.

<section id="slide-orgheadline12" class="juxt_spec">
<h2 id="orgheadline12">Example C: wrap-modified</h2>
<blockquote nil>
<p>
<b>5.2.  Conditionals</b>
</p>

<p>
The HTTP conditional request header fields [RFC7232] allow a client
to place a precondition on the state of the target resource, so that
the action corresponding to the method semantics will <b>not</b> be applied
if the precondition evaluates to false.
</p>

<p>
― RFC 7231
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
For my final example, this is Ring's implementation of conditional requests. Again, let's remind ourselves what a conditional request is. The point of a conditional request is to avoid the waste of constructing state that the client already has. It's part of HTTP's ability to scale services to, well, 'web-scale'.
</p>

<p>
But let's look at Ring's implementation:
</p>

</aside>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-orgheadline13">
<h2 id="orgheadline13">Example C: wrap-modified</h2>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre><code class="clojure" >(defn wrap-not-modified
  "Middleware that returns a 304 Not Modified from the wrapped handler
  if the handler response has an ETag or Last-Modified header, and the
  request has a If-None-Match or If-Modified-Since header that matches
  the response."
  {:added "1.2"}
  [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (-> (handler request) ; WAT?
        (not-modified-response request))))
</code></pre>
</div>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Here we see that the entire response is created <i>before</i> any predicate is evaluated. This is a 'smoke-and-mirrors' approach to HTTP compliance.
</p>

<p>
But is it a question of improving Ring middleware functions. I don't think so. Because it's not really the fault of any single Ring middleware, because the Ring middleware has very little to go on, it has no clues as to what the function it is wrapping actually does, the function is just a function. We can't tell anything about it, not even how many arguments it takes! Or we can do is apply it.

<p>
He presses it and a sign lights up telling him not to press the button again.
</p>

<p>
That's the same for Ring middleware. What would happen if we call this handler function? We can't know until we try.

This isn't a great way of building information systems.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
There's another problem with Ring middleware.
</p>

<p>
It's a 'pick-and-mix' approach- we pick the bits of HTTP we want to implement (or rather have time to implement) and ignore the rest. It's debateable whether it's even possible to implement a comprehensive HTTP service in Ring.

</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
yada is able to take a Java string and determine all kinds of things about it.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we know Java strings are immutable right? So we can see when the yada function was called, and we know that is the last possible modification date for the string.
</p>

<p>
Let's see the result of this expression
</p>

<p>
(click link)
</p>

<p>
What do we have here. Lots of data, which has been converted to HTML with the json-html library because yada knows we're using a browser, or at least something that accepts HTML.
</p>

<p>
Look at these methods at the top. Because the string is immutable, we can rule out PUT, POST and DELETE methods.

Unless of course the string <i>is</i> mutable, and then we can add in those other methods too. In this case we can add a watcher to the atom to know when updates are made, which will help us provide HTTP response headers to support conditional requests.

Because everything we need is now in a data model, we can easily transform it to a Swagger specification which we can browse in the Swagger UI

<p>
The swagger code is quite straight-forward and makes for a good illustration of how to build your own yada type. Here's the swaggered function we saw earlier. It takes the user-provided swagger info and the route structure it's going to wrap.
</p>

<p>
Then it builds a bidi tree node, giving it the Swagger specification wrapped as a yada resource.

<p>
Here's the code for the bidi tree node. When matching a URI, it checks to see if the remaining path is <code>/swagger.json</code> - if so, it will handle the request and call our the yada resource we provided it. If not, it will delegate to the route structure it is wrapping. Simple stuff if you're familiar with bidi.

<p>
Finally, we mentioned the Swagger spec was wrapped as a yada resource. Here's the code.
</p>

<p>
Notice how the resource makes some claims via the <code>properties</code> function. It says that it renders JSON, preferrably in UTF-8 but will provide UTF-16 or UTF-32 if necessary.
</p>

<p>
We also generate the swagger JSON at this point, which is one line of code thanks to the ring-swagger library.
</p>

<p>
Notice how we're returning data again, which is fed into the model.
</p>

<p>
There's a second form of this properties function that is called on every request. These help yada implement conditional requests. The ETag is derived from the hash of the Swagger spec. If the spec changes, so will the ETag.
</p>

<p>
For the actual GET method we pull out the swagger spec, it's still a Clojure map at this point, and return it. Yada's body coercion mechanics handles the conversion to json. I've stripped down the code for the slides, but the real code does HTML and EDN too.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Remember that whatever router we want to use, there's advantages to using one where routes are data too. For example, if we want to apply a common resource policy to a group of resources, we can easily transform the data using common Clojure functions.
</p>

<p>
Take Clojure's postwalk for example. The point is, you don't need some feature to be implemented in yada or bidi or some other router to support this, you just manipulate the data however you want.
</p>

<p>
Add yada resources can be given identifiers too. See I've given the first "Hello World" resource an identifier, which can be used when creating URIs with bidi's <code>path-for</code> function.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
A real problem with a functional composition approach taken by Ring middlware is that ties the entire request processing cycle to a single thread. Many other language communities are fully embracing async programming models to address the cost implications of this approach.
</p>

<p>
And so yada completely supports async, it's built on Zach Tellman's manifold, which is just the most amazing library in my opinion, and it makes async incredibly easy.

It's hard to express how awesome manifold is. Whenever you need to do some I/O in yada, you can simply return a future and perform the work in a separate thread.

<h2 id="orgheadline40">Or any other deferred value</h2>

Here's a full search engine implementation!

<p>
Or you can return anything that manifold terms a 'deferred' value. If you need to make client requests to another HTTP service, and you use Aleph, it already returns deferred values so you don't have to do anything!
</p>

<p>
Last night in the sauna we were discussing the fact that many of Clojure library names, such as 'system' or 'boot' are totally ungoogleable. (apologies to Daniel and Micha, I didn't want to mention your names!)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I said I'd try to develop a new search engine that would solve this problem. And here it is!
</p>

<p>
Let me explain what's going on. Our GET method calls into Aleph's client with a GET method. Aleph immediately returns a deferred value to yada, which in turn passes that back to the Aleph server it is running on. Later on, when Google starts returning a response, it is handled completely by Aleph. At no point are we blocking on I/O.
</p>

<p>
This is all done without core.async channels, go blocks or callbacks.

<h2 id="orgheadline41">Async everywhere!</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
yada allows you to return deferred values anytime it makes sense to do so, and even in some places where it doesn't. For the vast majority of options, properties and methods, you can choose to return deferred values like futures, promises, core.async channels and more. yada, or rather manifold, takes care of everything.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
And because we're built on an Async foundation, doing Server Sent Events is really easy too.
</p>

<p>
Here's a function that puts "Hello World" into a channel every second. We simply return the channel wrapped in yada, and magic, we get a server-sent event stream.
</p>

<p>
Well I really must be out of time now, so let's wrap up.
